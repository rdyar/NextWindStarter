- \_siteConfig file for lots of default settings like address info, site url, plausible etc.
  - used in footer address section, footer copyright, sitemapCreator, Tracker
- sitemapCreator, runs after build step, creates a sitemap of all files not excluded
- Tracker component for plausible analytics
- Set to use trailing slashes for urls to match jekyll, set in `next.config: trailingSlash: true`
- MDX markdown support built in. Though you have to import the mdx file into a pages' file.
- Site is exported as static HTML via the `next export` command in `package.json >> build` step.
- \_Document.js file to inject `Html lang="en"` into head

## Navbar

The navigation is split into mobile and desktop. Mobile links are buttons and you probably can't have more than 3.  
You can define the nav items for each nav bar via objects at the top of the page.

The navbar is sticky - so it sticks to the top until you scroll down past the first page of content (?).

## Footer

The footer has 3 columns on desktop, the 3rd column is address info coming from the config file. It sticks to the bottom on screens without enough content to push it there.

## PageHead Component

On each page you should import the PageHead component and pass it a `meta` object that contains that pages' title and description that should be in the html head section for SEO. The PageHead component pulls in various things from the config to set some og tags as well. **You should probably go thru the PageHead component and make sure you agree with what it is doing**.

## Style Guide

Some basic styles are preset, see the [style guide](/samples/style-guide/).  
These styles are in the styles/global.css file under the tailwind @layer base section.
